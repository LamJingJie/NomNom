# NomNom
**Hackathon 2025**

## Introduction
NomNom is an application designed to enhance social interactions by allowing friends to recommend restaurants to each other. Users can choose to recommend or not recommend a restaurant, making it easier to consolidate and view recommendations. This is especially useful for future reference, as recommendations can often get lost in text messages over time. By streamlining the recommendation process, this app ensures that users can easily access and manage restaurant suggestions from their friends, which are typically shared through messaging apps like Telegram or WhatsApp.
